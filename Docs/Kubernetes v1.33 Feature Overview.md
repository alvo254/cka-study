## Core System Enhancements

### 1. `.kuberc` User Preferences (Alpha)

The introduction of the `.kuberc` file creates a clean boundary between user preferences and cluster credentials.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    User([User])
    subgraph "Old Approach"
        kubeconfig1["kubeconfig\n- Credentials\n- Preferences\n- Aliases"]
    end
    
    subgraph "New v1.33 Approach"
        kuberc[".kuberc\n- User Preferences\n- Aliases\n- Default Flags"]
        kubeconfig2["kubeconfig\n- Credentials Only\n- Cluster Connections"]
    end
    
    User --> kubeconfig1
    User --> kuberc
    User --> kubeconfig2
    
    classDef new fill:#d6ffe2,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    class kuberc new
```

**Implementation Details:**

- Environment flag: `KUBECTL_KUBERC=true`
- Default location: `~/.kube/kuberc`
- Can specify custom path: `--kuberc /path/to/kuberc`
- Stored in YAML format
- Can contain aliases, default flags, output preferences

**Example `.kuberc` File:**

```yaml
aliases:
  k: kubectl
  kgp: kubectl get pods
  kga: kubectl get all

defaults:
  apply:
    server-side: true
  
output:
  format: yaml
  color: true
```

### 2. Sidecar Containers (Stable)

Sidecar containers, which share the same lifecycle and resources as the main container, have graduated to stable.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Pod((Pod))
    Pod --> Main["Main Container\nApplication Logic"]
    Pod --> SC1["Sidecar Container\nLogging"]
    Pod --> SC2["Sidecar Container\nMonitoring"]
    
    subgraph "Shared Resources"
        VL["Volume"]
        NS["Network Space"]
    end
    
    Main --- VL
    SC1 --- VL
    SC2 --- VL
    Main --- NS
    SC1 --- NS
    SC2 --- NS
    
    classDef stable fill:#90EE90,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    class Pod,Main,SC1,SC2 stable
```

**Key Improvements:**

- Proper handling of container startup and shutdown sequences
- Improved resource sharing mechanisms
- Enhanced status reporting
- Better integration with other Kubernetes features

### 3. In-place Resource Resize (Beta)

This feature allows resources to be resized without restarting pods, providing more flexibility for applications.

```mermaid

    participant User
    participant API as API Server
    participant Kubelet
    participant Container
    
    User->>API: Request resource resize
    API->>Kubelet: Notify of resource change
    Kubelet->>Container: Resize resources in-place
    Container->>Kubelet: Acknowledge resize
    Kubelet->>API: Update pod status
    API->>User: Confirm completion
    
    Note over Container: No restart required
```

**Supported Resource Types:**

- CPU limits and requests
